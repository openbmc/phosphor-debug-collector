      "message": "The ramoops type will automatically include all files in the optional_path specified when captured. The SYSTEMD_PSTORE_PATH is used so everything in /var/lib/systemd/pstore would be included, which should include the kernel trace.\n\nI was not able to prove this. I talked to Eddie James and he believes there is another problem preventing the trace being captured, but that it should be corrected under a different change.",
