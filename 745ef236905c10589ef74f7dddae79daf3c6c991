      "message": "@mdmii@outlook.com @matt.fischer@hpe.com sorry for the late response - I completely missed this discussion.\n\nThe proposed fix works - the variable expands to the correct path (I tested it). However, it is not expanded by meson, but by Yocto using SYSTEMD_SUBSTITUTIONS in the base recipe afaic: https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/blob/bf402a30368f1c48744c1626b78676843e97b072/meta-phosphor/recipes-phosphor/dump/phosphor-debug-collector_git.bb#L47C1-L48C1\n\nIf you build this using meson directly (not bitbake) and install the service files, the variable won\u0027t be substituted.  The proper fix is to use meson\u0027s configure_file() so the project works standalone without relying on yocto.\n\nI\u0027d be happy to accept this as a temporary fix and follow up with the meson based solution, if @mdmii@outlook.com and/or @ojayanth@gmail.com agree.",
