      "message": "dump::Entry is never intended to be created on its own, but always as a sub-class of some other dump type.  Since the class is inherited, `emit_no_signals` is correct because the child class should be the one emitting the signals.\n\n```\nbmc_dump_entry.hpp:class Entry : virtual public EntryIfaces, virtual public phosphor::dump::Entry\ndump-extensions/openpower-dumps/resource_dump_entry.hpp:class Entry : virtual public EntryIfaces, virtual public phosphor::dump::Entry\ndump-extensions/openpower-dumps/system_dump_entry.hpp:class Entry : virtual public EntryIfaces, virtual public phosphor::dump::Entry\ndump_entry.hpp:class Entry : public EntryIfaces\nfaultlog_dump_entry.hpp:class Entry : virtual public phosphor::dump::Entry\n```\n\nbmc_dump_entry.hpp as an example has `defer_emit` and a call to `emit_object_added` later in the constructor.\n\nI don\u0027t see this proposal as correct or solving the problem.  If you\u0027re missing the signal for the bmc::Entry, we need to investigate that.",
