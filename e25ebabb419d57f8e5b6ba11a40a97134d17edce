      "message": "The existing inheritance structure here consists of only two levels. This was primarily constructed due to the system dump which, unlike other dumps, isn\u0027t stored or collected on the BMC. However, all other dumps adhere to the same operations as the BMC dump. This level of inheritance was implemented to prevent code duplication.\n\nHere inheritance is used because there is a clear is-a relationship",
