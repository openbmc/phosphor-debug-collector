      "message": "Because I believe that during a coredump, ftrace messages have a higher priority and stricter real-time requirements (I encountered cases during actual debugging where criticalinformation was lost due to trace priority).\n\nAdditionally, there was already a duplicate functionality (with a traceevents\u0027s commit explicitly mentioning that its priority was not high).  \n\nSo, I thought of splitting it into two parts (or is it that currently we cannot adjust the priority for each type?).\nAs a result, the current `lktrace` is renamed to be specifically for coredump only.",

Keep the lktrace name as it is only chnage priority.\n\nBoth got pros and cons  high level my understanding is \"Core Dumps: Use for post-mortem analysis of crashes and  ftrace: Use for real-time tracing and performance analysis.\" . Let us initiate discussion in discord to get some input from other devlopers and we can set priority appropriately based on inputs,",
