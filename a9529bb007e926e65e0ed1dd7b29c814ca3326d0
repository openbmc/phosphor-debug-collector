      "message": "@matt\nwe in openbmc do not support threads (not sure why though) but we support fork, can we allow usage of std::async as used in the above code? also the std::future was declared as global variable to force it to not to go out of scope(if it goes out of scope the thread used in std::async will be detached), will that have any other issues. Or there any other better alternatives? coroutines?",
