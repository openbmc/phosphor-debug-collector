Or there any other better alternatives? coroutines?",

You can accomplish the same thing without threads by simply calling pldm_send instead of pldm_send_recv.  If you want to log an error if the delete fails, you can add the response fd to your event loop.\n\nIdeally we would not give the caller a response until the job is actually done.  neither of these approaches (the one taken in the patch or my alternative suggestion) don\u0027t give the caller any way to figure out if their call worked or not.  That just isn\u0027t a good interface.\n\nTo provide a good interface that allows the caller to know if the operation was successful or not there are a couple options.  Unfortunately none of them are easy.\n\n1 - switch this program to sdbusplus asio.  that allows you make your pldm calls _and_ delay your response to the delete client.\n2 - come up with an async delete dbus interface that returns a task object and implement that.\n3 - add or wait-for support to phosphor-dbus-interfaces that lets you delay your response to the delete client while you do other IPC.",
