      "message": "I\u0027ve previously noticed and tested a scenario where multiple error logs generated at the same time can lead to a fork bomb. This issue mainly arises because the creation of dump requests isn\u0027t serialized, as these elog dump requests do not go through the d-bus. The observations were confirmed during tests that involved creating numerous InternalFailure error logs using the busctl command. It\u0027s still uncertain if this scenario could occur under real-world conditions.\n\nLooking ahead, if this method is modified to handle more error logs, there\u0027s a chance we might miss dumps related to these logs. So, my suggestion is to limit the number of elog dumps happening at the same time rather than completely stopping a second one from occurring. With this change, looks like, the dump manager stops an elog dump even when there\u0027s a user-initiated dump going on.\"",
