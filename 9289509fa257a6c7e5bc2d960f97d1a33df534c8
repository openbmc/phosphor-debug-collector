      "message": "This commit is not correct as-is.  Something else must be going on.\n\nWhat kind of Entry was it you were having trouble with?  A `bmc_dump_entry.hpp:Entry`?\n\nThe constructor of dump_entry::Entry purposefully does no-emit because the expectation is that it is always inherited from (with additional interfaces added).\nThe bmc::Entry correctly does defer-emit and then at the end of the constructor does an `emit_object_added` call, which will trigger the creation signals.  Having called `emit_object_added` it should also trigger the destruction signals when the object is destructed.  This is what you don\u0027t seem to be seeing?",

As noted in the \"Tested\", the destruction does not emit signal, that leaves the mapper still see the object, while it\u0027s gone on DBus.\n\nYou should be able to reproduce the issue by just creating a dump and delete it.",
