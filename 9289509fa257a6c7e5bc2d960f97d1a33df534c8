      "message": "This commit is not correct as-is.  Something else must be going on.\n\nWhat kind of Entry was it you were having trouble with?  A `bmc_dump_entry.hpp:Entry`?\n\nThe constructor of dump_entry::Entry purposefully does no-emit because the expectation is that it is always inherited from (with additional interfaces added).\nThe bmc::Entry correctly does defer-emit and then at the end of the constructor does an `emit_object_added` call, which will trigger the creation signals.  Having called `emit_object_added` it should also trigger the destruction signals when the object is destructed.  This is what you don\u0027t seem to be seeing?",
