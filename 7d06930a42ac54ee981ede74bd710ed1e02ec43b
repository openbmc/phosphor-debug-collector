( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28538091/using-persistent-storage-in-linux-kernel). Also not covered error scenarios, like missing pstore file due t some errors.\n\nAnother approach would be add code to create log in the clean shutdown or reboot path and check here ( Reference :https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/692624/can-i-reliably-determine-if-the-last-reboot-was-due-to-a-kernel-panic).\n\nAdding Andrew to comment, who worked on this area initially.",
