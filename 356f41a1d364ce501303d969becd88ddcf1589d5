      "message": "The guard tool is openpower specific now so it will affect the non-openpower based system BMC dump collection.\n\nPlease enable it as openpower specific plugin.\n\nAlso, there is one more plugin in the openbmc/openbmc (https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/blob/master/meta-openpower/recipes-phosphor/dump/phosphor-debug-collector/plugins.d/guard) that\u0027s just dump the complete guard file but, `guard -l` just returns unresolved records.\n\nThe difference is, we need a guard tool to read the guard file since it is a specific format but, I am ok to add `guard -l` since it helps without relying on the guard tool if we don\u0027t have space constraints.",

      "message": "The limitation is this approch, GUARD tool got depenedncy on devtree and this is going to fail incase devtree softlink is not cerated or and devtree issue . So better to update the existing openpower plugin, like run the gurad tool , if it is failed copy the guard file.\n\nLong term direction isto add custom pluging to dumputils based guard file",
