      "message": "The guard tool is openpower specific now so it will affect the non-openpower based system BMC dump collection.\n\nPlease enable it as openpower specific plugin.\n\nAlso, there is one more plugin in the openbmc/openbmc (https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/blob/master/meta-openpower/recipes-phosphor/dump/phosphor-debug-collector/plugins.d/guard) that\u0027s just dump the complete guard file but, `guard -l` just returns unresolved records.\n\nThe difference is, we need a guard tool to read the guard file since it is a specific format but, I am ok to add `guard -l` since it helps without relying on the guard tool if we don\u0027t have space constraints.",
